# LEARNING DEEP LEARNING BY DOING - Project 1 
This is a self assigned deep learning project in which I make in practice  

## L2SVM as loss function 
According to this [paper :Deep Learning using Linear Support Vector Machines
](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/deep-learning-using-linear-support-vector) L2SVM might improve the overall accuracy over sigmoid activation functions so I will use L2SVM as loss function and compare it to sigmoid

## Ensemble of Networks 
Ensemble of network might improve the overall accuracy by combining multiple models such that each model might excel at a specific type of detection 

## K-fold cross validation 
Helps us avoid overfitting by changing the target data each data at validation
